0,"The image shows a spreadsheet with three columns and twelve rows, representing a monthly budget or financial tracking for a year.

The columns are:

1. In: This column likely represents the amount of money that was received or came in during each month.
2. Out: This column likely represents the amount of money that was spent or went out during each month.
3. Savings: This column shows the difference between the amount that came in and the amount that went out, which is the amount saved for each month.

The rows represent the months of the year, from January to December. Each row has three cells corresponding to the three columns, showing the respective values for each month.

For example, in January, the In value is 5, the Out value is 1, and the Savings value is 4 (5 - 1 = 4). This pattern continues for each month, with the Savings value being the difference between the In and Out values.

The numbers in the Savings column are highlighted in a different color, possibly to draw attention to the savings amount.

The spreadsheet is a simple tool for tracking personal or business finances, allowing the user to see at a glance how much money was saved each month.",45.43519592285156
